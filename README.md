### üõ´ Quick Start & Usage 

The library is designed to be intuitive. Here are a few examples to get you started.

| Object             | url                                                     |
| -------------------| ------------------------------------------------------- |
| underdata.league() | `https://www.understat.com/league/<league_name>/<year>` |
| underdata.team()   | `https://www.understat.com/team/<team_name>/<year>`     |
| underdata.player() | `https://www.understat.com/player/<player_id>`          |
| underdata.match()  | `https://www.understat.com/player/<match_id>`           |


#### 1. Get League Standings

Analyze an entire league's performance. The `get_teams()` method can provide a basic or advanced statistical table.
```python
from underdata.league import League

# Initialize the league for a specific season
la_liga = League(league_name="La_liga", season=2023)

# Get the advanced standings table
teams_df = la_liga.get_teams(advanced=True)

print("La Liga 2023/2024 Final Standings (Advanced Stats)")
print(teams_df.head())
```

#### 2. Analyze a Specific Team

Drill down into a single team's performance over a season.
```python
from underdata.team import Team

# Initialize a specific team
real_madrid = Team(team_name="Real Madrid", season=2023)

# Get the team's complete match history
match_history_df = real_madrid.get_match_history()

print("Real Madrid's Last 5 Matches of the Season:")
print(match_history_df.tail())
```

#### 3. Get Detailed Player Data

Analyze a single player's performance, including their shot data, perfect for creating shot maps.
```python
from soccermetrics.player import Player

# Initialize a player using their Understat ID (e.g., Jude Bellingham's ID is 8369)
bellingham = Player(player_id=8369)

# Get all shots from the 2023 season
bellingham_shots = bellingham.get_shot_data(season=2023)

print(f"Jude Bellingham took {len(bellingham_shots)} shots in the 2023/2024 season.")
print(bellingham_shots[['date', 'result', 'xG', 'shotType']].head())
```

#### 4. Analyze a Single Match

Get all the shot data and lineups from a specific match using its ID.
```python
from soccermetrics.match import Match

# Initialize a match using its Understat ID (e.g., a Real Madrid vs Barcelona match)
el_clasico = Match(match_id=21817)

# Get all shots from the match
shot_data = el_clasico.get_shot_data()

print(f"There were a total of {len(shot_data)} shots in the match.")
```
